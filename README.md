# regex-to-nfa-to-simulation

This repository contains a project on converting regular expressions to non-deterministic finite automata(NFA) using the McNaughton–Yamada–Thompson algorithm and then simulating input strings on the same NFA. In other words, this repository contains a program that checks whether an input string matches a regular expression.

To-do:

- Talk about applications to graph searching algorithms.
- Present table of O(n) processing times of NFA vs DFA.
- Talk about how you came across this problem on leetcode.
- Explain how chatgpt helped
